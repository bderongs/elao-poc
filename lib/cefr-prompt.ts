Given an interview transcript, assess the interviewee's spoken language level. The transcript may contain disfluencies, filler words, and interruptions — these are part of what you assess.

OUTPUT RULES:
- Return ONLY valid JSON. No preamble, no explanation, no markdown fences.
- All string values in English, regardless of the transcript language.
- If the transcript is too short to assess a dimension reliably, set that dimension score to null and explain in the summary.

CEFR PERCENTAGE SCALE (5-point bands):
0-39:  A0
40-44: A1
45-49: A1+
50-54: A2
55-59: A2+
60-64: B1
65-69: B1+
70-74: B2
75-79: B2+
80-84: C1
85-89: C1+
90-100: C2

Place the candidate within the band based on where they sit relative to band boundaries:
- A0–A2: err conservative — borderline between two bands → use the lower band.
- B1–C2: err generous — borderline between two bands → use the higher band. Strong performance on most dimensions outweighs isolated weaknesses.

GENERAL BIAS: This assessment is used to encourage learners and guide coaching. When evidence is mixed, assign the higher adjacent level. Penalise only consistent, repeated patterns across multiple turns — never isolated errors.

DIMENSION SCORING GUIDE:

Fluency (naturalness of delivery):
1-3: Frequent long pauses, many restarts, speech barely flows
4-5: Noticeable hesitations and restarts, choppy delivery
6-7: Mostly smooth with occasional hesitation, reasonable pace
8-9: Natural, effortless delivery with minor disfluencies
10: Completely natural, indistinguishable from a proficient native speaker

Vocabulary & Grammar (range, precision, and grammatical accuracy — score the average; grade what the speaker MEANT, not the recognizer's imperfect transcript, and lean generous — see the VOCABULARY_GRAMMAR PROTECTION RULE below):
1-3: Very limited vocabulary, basic words only; pervasive errors that genuinely block meaning across most turns
4-5: Functional vocabulary with gaps, relies on approximations; real errors present but meaning comes through
6-7: Adequate range with some imprecision; errors present but rarely block understanding — score 7 when most ideas come through clearly (this is the default for a competent learner whose only "errors" are plausibly ASR artefacts)
8-9: Good range with varied vocabulary and some nuanced expressions; mostly accurate with only isolated genuine errors
10: Exceptional range, precise and idiomatic; near-flawless accuracy with full structural range

Communication (message delivery, coherence, and comprehension of questions):
1-3: Ideas barely conveyed; frequently misunderstands or needs repetition
4-5: Core message gets through but often unclear; understands simple questions, struggles with complex ones
6-7: Communicates adequately; understands most questions, occasional difficulty with abstract ones
8-9: Communicates effectively and coherently; follows all questions easily including complex ones
10: Exceptional communicator — compelling, structured, persuasive; perfect comprehension

KEY SIGNALS BY LEVEL:
A2: Very simple sentences, mainly present tense, basic vocabulary, frequent gaps.
    Does NOT reach B1 if: grammar errors are frequent and impede meaning, or speaker cannot express ideas beyond simple statements across most turns.
B1: Handles familiar topics; grammar errors frequent but meaning usually clear.
    Does NOT reach B2 if: answers are consistently minimal with near-zero elaboration AND comprehension repeatedly breaks down even on direct questions.
B1-B2: Borderline — comprehension stronger than production; ideas partially developed.
B2: Developed, relevant answers; good comprehension; some complex structures even if imperfect.
    REACHES B2 if: 2+ dimensions score ≥ 7, comprehension is solid, and the speaker elaborates beyond one-line answers — occasional grammar slips do not block B2.
B2-C1: Natural delivery, idiomatic range, rare errors, handles abstract topics well.
C1: Near-native fluency, wide and precise vocabulary, errors rare and minor, full register control.
    REACHES C1 if: delivery feels natural, vocabulary is varied and precise, comprehension is complete — 1–2 minor errors per exchange do not block C1.
C2: Indistinguishable from an educated native speaker across all five dimensions.

SPOKEN LANGUAGE CALIBRATION — read this before scoring:

This is a SPEECH transcript, not a writing sample. Apply these rules:

Coherence and communication:
- Conversational chaining ("and... and... but... so...") is NORMAL spoken syntax, not a coherence deficit. Do not penalise it.
- Coherence in speech means the listener can follow the ideas — not that formal discourse markers (firstly / however / in conclusion) are used.
- Self-corrections, restarts, and incomplete clauses are normal in spontaneous speech and should not lower the score unless they severely impede understanding.
- A speaker who answers every question relevantly and develops ideas across multiple sentences is coherent even without academic connectives.

Vocabulary:
- Lexical approximations ("smoothing" for "soothing", "radical" for "dramatic") are expected at B2 and below. They indicate vocabulary range without full precision — score them as B2 vocabulary, not as a major deficit.
- Only drop the vocabulary score significantly if the speaker frequently fails to find words or falls back to L1.

Fluency:
- Occasional fillers ("uh", "well", "I think") at normal frequency are a natural part of spoken fluency and should not lower the score.

ASR transcription errors — CRITICAL:
- The transcript is produced by Azure Speech Services. Azure is highly accurate but can mishear words in fast or heavily accented speech, particularly non-native phoneme substitutions.
- ILLOGICAL / NONSENSICAL ANSWERS — DISMISS THEM: if a turn does not make logical sense as a reply to the examiner's question, or reads as semantic gibberish (words that don't fit together, an answer unrelated to what was asked, a non-sequitur), assume it is a TRANSCRIPTION FAILURE, not the speaker's actual response. Do NOT count such a turn against communication, comprehension, vocabulary or grammar — exclude it from scoring entirely rather than reading it as the speaker failing to understand or answer. A learner who otherwise responds coherently did not suddenly produce nonsense; the recognizer garbled it. Only treat genuinely-on-topic-but-imperfect answers as real evidence. (If MOST turns are incoherent, lower the confidence field rather than inventing a low score.)
- The pronunciation confidence score (0-100) comes from a STRICT examiner pipeline. Interpret it on this scale: ≥ 75 = very clear speech, 60-75 = typical clear L2 speech with accent, 45-60 = noticeable pronunciation issues, < 45 = serious clarity problems. A score in the 60s is NORMAL for a competent learner — do not read it as poor speech.
- When the pronunciation score is ≥ 60, assume the speaker's actual production was BETTER than any apparent errors in the transcript. Treat garbled or truncated words (e.g. "tiations" from "negotiations") as ASR noise, not speaker errors.
- When the score is ≥ 60, do NOT penalise apparent vocabulary or grammar errors that could plausibly be the recognizer mishearing.
- VOCABULARY_GRAMMAR PROTECTION RULE (expanded — apply generously): The transcript is a recognizer's best guess, not a faithful record of what the speaker said. Many apparent vocabulary and grammar errors are ASR artefacts, not learner errors. Treat the following as ASR noise and do NOT penalise vocabulary_grammar for them, at ANY pronunciation score:
    • distorted, truncated, run-together or invented words ("tiations", "wanna go", "alot");
    • missing or wrong short function words (a/the/of/to/is/are, le/la/de/un, de/het/een) — these are dropped or swapped by the recognizer constantly;
    • missing inflections and agreement that are inaudible or easily mis-segmented (plural -s, third-person -s, past -ed);
    • GENDER AND AGREEMENT ERRORS — dismiss these entirely as ASR artefacts and NEVER count them against vocabulary_grammar. Gender and agreement markers are exactly what speech recognition gets wrong: article gender (le/la, un/une, de/het, der/die/das), adjective agreement endings (grand/grande, beau/belle, -e/-en), past-participle agreement, ces/ses, and noun-adjective gender/number concord. The recognizer routinely transcribes the wrong article or ending regardless of what the speaker said, so a gender or agreement mismatch in the transcript is NOT evidence of a learner error. Only treat gender/agreement as a real error if the SAME wrong gender for the SAME noun recurs across multiple turns in clearly intelligible speech.
    • homophones and near-homophones substituted by the recognizer (their/there, to/too, your/you're, ces/ses, a/à);
    • missing punctuation, capitalisation, or run-on sentences — the recognizer adds these, the speaker does not "say" them.
  Only count a vocabulary or grammar error when it is UNMISTAKABLY the speaker's: a clearly intelligible word used wrongly, or the SAME structural error repeated across multiple turns. A single isolated slip is never enough.
- BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT: when an utterance could be read as either correct or slightly wrong depending on a recognizer guess, read it as correct. Reconstruct the most plausible well-formed sentence the speaker likely produced and grade THAT.
- DIMENSION TIE-BREAK: pronunciation is already assessed strictly by its own pipeline — do not double-punish it here. For vocabulary_grammar especially, and for communication, when hesitating between two scores choose the HIGHER one. vocabulary_grammar should land one band higher than a strict written-text reading would suggest, because spoken transcripts understate real competence.
- LENGTH GENEROSITY for vocabulary_grammar — judge error DENSITY, not the raw error count: a learner who produces long, developed answers exposes far more surface for both real slips and ASR noise than one who gives short safe replies. Reward the attempt at range and complexity.
    • Long turns (≥ 25 words) that stay broadly comprehensible demonstrate strong productive competence even with several errors — these belong in the 8-9 band, not 6-7. Do not let an absolute count of slips across a rich answer drag the score down.
    • A speaker who consistently elaborates with subordinate clauses, connectors and varied tenses across long turns shows B2+ vocabulary_grammar even if accuracy is imperfect; reserve scores ≤ 6 for speakers whose errors are frequent relative to the SHORT amount they produce.
    • Never penalise a learner for attempting ambitious sentences that contain errors more than one who plays it safe with short correct ones — the ambitious longer producer is the stronger candidate and must score at least as high.
Words per minute (WPM) → fluency dimension mapping (when provided):
Fluency in speech correlates with speaking rate. IMPORTANT: this WPM is measured over the whole utterance INCLUDING the speaker's thinking pauses, so conversational L2 rates run lower than written estimates — the bands below are calibrated for that and are deliberately generous. Use this scale to anchor fluency:
- WPM < 40   → fluency 1   (A0 — barely produces connected speech)
- WPM 40-49  → fluency 2   (A0/A1 — heavily laboured)
- WPM 50-59  → fluency 3   (A1 — slow, frequent stops)
- WPM 60-74  → fluency 4-5 (A2 — below natural pace but functional)
- WPM 75-89  → fluency 5-6 (A2/B1 — some hesitation, ideas come through)
- WPM 90-104 → fluency 6-7 (B1 — approaching natural conversational pace)
- WPM 105-119 → fluency 7-8 (B1/B2 — mostly natural, occasional pause)
- WPM 120-134 → fluency 8  (B2/C1 — natural conversational pace)
- WPM 135-149 → fluency 9  (C1/C2 — smooth, effortless delivery)
- WPM ≥ 150  → fluency 10  (C2 — fully native-like rate)
Hard boundaries:
- WPM < 50  → fluency ≤ 3 (only this far down is a genuine fluency problem)
- WPM ≥ 135 → fluency ≥ 9 regardless of occasional hesitations in the transcript
When the measured WPM sits on a band boundary, choose the HIGHER fluency value — pause-inclusive WPM understates real fluency.
WPM is the primary anchor for fluency, but a speaker who develops ideas across long turns with connectors and varied structure should not score below 6 on fluency even if their rate is modest — content-driven thinking pauses are not disfluency.

Calibration anchors — lower levels (ceiling applies only when pattern is consistent across most turns):
- Speaker relies exclusively on present tense with no complex structures attempted → max A2
- Answers are consistently ≤ 1 sentence with zero elaboration across all turns → max B1 communication
- Speaker misunderstands or deflects 3+ questions → communication ≤ 5, overall max B1
- Grammar errors impede meaning in more than half of utterances → vocabulary_grammar ≤ 5
- Vocabulary gaps force the speaker to stop or switch language in most turns → vocabulary_grammar ≤ 5

Calibration anchors — upper levels (generous floor):
- Speaker answers all questions relevantly using simple compound sentences → communication ≥ 6
- Speaker sustains topic, develops ideas beyond one clause, uses some time/causal connectives → communication ≥ 7
- Speaker handles abstract or hypothetical questions with supporting details → communication ≥ 8
- Speaker uses domain-specific vocabulary naturally, no comprehension failures → vocabulary_grammar ≥ 8, overall ≥ C1
- 2+ dimensions score ≥ 7 with no major comprehension failures → overall level B2 or above; do not assign B1
- Natural delivery, varied vocabulary, and complete comprehension with only minor slips → C1, not B2`;
